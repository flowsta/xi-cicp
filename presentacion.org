* Abstract

** In very few years
In journalism, we have gone from looking at social
science techniques, what was called precision journalism, to dealing
with open data as a huge source of information.

** The data journalism to come
Journalism connects with data science in the sense of using
--again-- scientific methods to extract knowledge and insights from
structured data.
** Prototypes
This article offers an overview of that evolution and
focuses on some prototypes that have emerged in this new journalistic
ecosystem of data journalism, data visualisation and data literacy.


* Keywords 
Data Journalism, Data Visualisation, Journalism, Data science, Social Science, Open Data

* Introduction

- Practice runs parallel to experimentation.
- Long string of prototypes
 - Experimentation;
 - Interest;
 - Skills
** 2009
*** The modern data journalism
2009, sheltered by:

1. the open data portals
2. the popularity of open source and
3. standardization of HTML5

*** the perfect scenario

- sources of data
- tools
- output formats

*** First piece of The Guardian Data Blog

- Data sources from Open Data portals
- Tools from computer science
- Web

*** and eventually Data Science

The journalist as a kind of
- data scientist
- web designer
- web developer
- computer programmer

** Telling stories based on Data

Method of data journalism, Paul Bradshaw

- Compile
- Clean
- Context
- Combine
- Communicate

** Rewind: Computer Assisted Reporting, 1952

- The CBS tried to predict the results of the USA presidential elections using a computer.
- That was the first national broadcast (coast to coast) of a national
  election.
- Walter Conkrite as M.C.
- A Remington Rand UNIVAC predicted an Eisenhower's landslide victory.
- Conkrite explained that they used it as a complement not as the main
  part of his investigation

*** UNIVAC

#+begin_quote
We saw it as an added feature to our coverage that could be very interesting in the future, and
there was a great deal of pride that we had this exclusively. But I don't think that we felt the
computer would become predominant in our coverage in any way.
#+end_quote

** IRE and NICAR

- Is it the work with computers and data what determines to be CAR?
- Meyer's “Detroit Riots” research introduced the methodoloy in the daily journalistic work.
- In 1989 is founded the NICAR National Institute of Computer-Assisted
  Reporting with the support of the IRE (Investigative Reporters and
  Editors)

** Landing in Spain, 1990
- José Luis Dáder and Pedro Gómez had attended to various events.
- The development of 'precision journalism' in the USA.
- A new socio-statistical information

** Forward to Data Journalism

- Data Journalism
- Data Driven Journalism
- Database Journalism

*** Knowledge
- Journalism
- Design
- Programming
- Statistics

*** To operate as a
- Data journalist
- Computer assisted repoerter
- newsroom developer
- journo-geek

Troy Thibodeaux, Poynter

*** With a set of tools
- Statistical methods of social scientists
- Mapping tools of GIS
- Visualisation arts of statistics and graphic design
- Computer science skills
  - Web development
  - General-purpose programming
  - Database administration
  - Systems engineering
  - Data mining
  - Cryptography

*** To develop

- Classic CAR stories
- Interactive graphics
- Applications
- Tools for writing Websites

** But What is Data?
- Anything countable can count as data
- Anything that a computer processes is data.

** Real Data Journalism
- A tendency to look for what is categorizable, quantifiable and comparable in any news topic
- A conviction that technology, properly applied to these aspects, can tell us something
about the story that is both worth knowing and unknowable in any other
way.

** Recommendations
*** Thibodeaux
- Do not care what you know
- Do not mind how to write the story
- Either through words or pixels, "write!".
- Pick up what's at hand
- Learn what you need
- Get to something real as soon as possible.

*** Holovaty
- Who cares?
- I hope my competitors waste their time arguing about this as long as
possible.
*** Bradshaw
- All the information is reduced to numbers
- To 0 and 1, bits.
- The data are not only the source but also the tool
- Or the story
- Or it can be both

** The misunderstanding of data visualisation
- Not having into account visualisation as part of the
analytic stage
- One of the typical errors of many data journalism
- Data analysis it is also performed with visualisation tools.

** Open Data Journalism
- Open data can be used freely as a data source
- The journalistic product is open data
- The data sources and the methodology are published and shared

** Spanish Data Journalism Scene
- Data Journalism Working Group
- Master from URJC-Unidad Editorial
- Open Data and Data Journalism Conference.
- Data Journalism Workshop.
- El Confidencial, ABC, El Mundo.
- Civio, Datalab, Datadista

* Prototypes

- England, August 2011.
- A young is killed by police in Tottenham
- Protests and riots in the streets
- Meyer's "Detroit Riot" is ans inspiration to deal with it.

** Our proposal: 13 prototypes

- Interactive tools
- Classic stories CAR
- Tools for writing
- Websites with a set of articles
- Data visualisation.
- General purpose applications
- Public service tools
