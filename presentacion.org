* Abstract

** In very few years
In journalism, we have gone from looking at social
science techniques, what was called precision journalism, to dealing
with open data as a huge source of information.

** The data journalism to come
Journalism connects with data science in the sense of using
--again-- scientific methods to extract knowledge and insights from
structured data.
** Prototypes
This article offers an overview of that evolution and
focuses on some prototypes that have emerged in this new journalistic
ecosystem of data journalism, data visualisation and data literacy.


* Keywords 
Data Journalism, Data Visualisation, Journalism, Data science, Social Science, Open Data

* Introduction

- Practice runs parallel to experimentation.
- Long string of prototypes
 - Experimentation;
 - Interest;
 - Skills
** 2009
*** The modern data journalism
2009, sheltered by:

1. the open data portals
2. the popularity of open source and
3. standardization of HTML5

*** the perfect scenario

- sources of data
- tools
- output formats

* History
** Computer Assisted Reporting, 1952

- The CBS tried to predict the results of the USA presidential elections using a computer.
- That was the first national broadcast (coast to coast) of a national
  election.
- Walter Conkrite as M.C.
- A Remington Rand UNIVAC predicted an Eisenhower's landslide victory.
- Conkrite explained that they used it as a complement not as the main
  part of his investigation

** Precision Journalism, 1967

- Philip Meyer's Detroit Riots
- First piece of precision journalism
- The methods of investigation from social sciences
- Applied to journalism

** IRE, 1975; and NICAR, 1989

- Is it the work with computers and data what determines to be CAR?
- Meyer's "Detroit Riots" research introduced the methodoloy in the daily journalistic work.
- In 1989 is founded the NICAR National Institute of Computer-Assisted
  Reporting with the support of the IRE (Investigative Reporters and
  Editors)

** Precision Journalism, Spain, 1990
- José Luis Dáder and Pedro Gómez had attended to various events.
- The development of 'precision journalism' in the USA.
- A new socio-statistical information
- (...)

** Data Journalism is the new Punk, 2009-2012

- With three cords your formed a band.
- With three datasets you create a story

*** Stories based on Data

- Statistics
- Datascience

*** The journalist as a
- Data journalist
- Computer assisted reporter
- newsroom developer
- journo-geek

*** With a set of tools
- Statistical methods
- Mapping tools of GIS
- Visualisation arts of statistics and graphic design
- Computer science skills
  - Web development
  - General-purpose programming
  - Database administration
  - Systems engineering
  - Data mining

*** To develop

- Classic CAR stories
- Interactive graphics
- Applications
- Tools for writing
- Websites

* Prototypes

- England, August 2011.
- A young is killed by police in Tottenham
- Protests and riots in the streets
- Meyer's "Detroit Riot" is ans inspiration to deal with it.

** Our proposal: 13 prototypes

1. Applications or Newsapps
2. Interactive tools
3. Classic stories CAR
4. Tools for writing
5. Websites with a set of articles
6. Data visualisation.
7. General purpose applications
8. Public service tools
9. Maps
10. Single-page projects
11. Video
12. Leaks
13. Social sciences approach.
